      <h2>About the game</h2>
      <p>
    This game was created by <strong>Balint2</strong>. You can find my GitHub here:

  </p>

  <p>
    The core idea was inspired by <em>ThinkFun’s Rush Hour</em>. The goal is simple and satisfying:
    you push cars around the grid and try to get the red car off the board. Levels are designed
    to be brain-teasing but fair, and most puzzles can be solved with logic and careful planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you ever get stuck, the game includes a built-in solver algorithm that can suggest a
    solution for the current level — a great way to learn new techniques or get unstuck
    without spoiling the whole puzzle.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also build your own levels with the in-game editor, or generate new levels
    automatically using the procedural generator. Created levels can be uploaded to a server
    so other players can try them out — and you can play, rate, and review levels made by others.

    Looking for friendly competition? A PvP mode is currently in development so you’ll soon
    be able to challenge friends head-to-head. Stay tuned for updates and thanks for playing!

    The game is available in both <strong>Web</strong> and <strong>PC</strong> versions.
    The web version runs directly in your browser without any download required, making it
    the fastest way to jump in and start playing right here on the site.  
    The PC version, however, offers smoother performance and enhanced graphics.  
    A download link for the PC version is also provided here on the site.
